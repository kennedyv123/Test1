                    <h3>Soccer</h3>
                    <p>Ever since I could walk I've played soccer. I've always had a passion for it (probably becuase it runs in my family). My grandpa used to play proffessionally for the Netherlands national team and he kept the soccer trend going when he moved to America. He had my mom take up soccer, and when she met my dad he took up soccer also. Next thing I knew, I was on a soccer team with my sister and my parents as our coaches.</p>

                    <h3>League of Legends</h3>
                    <p>Playing LOL has become a big part of my life. Whenever someone texts me "What's up?" I seem to always respond with "playing league." There's nothing else that I'd rather be doing with my life. I love the gaming atmosphere and I love the game-lingo between fellow players. In fact, I've become so infatuated with the game-lingo that I've even started to use it in real life.</p>

                    <h3>Dogs</h3>
                    <p>I love dogs. More specifically, I love my dogs. I am the proud owner of two magnificent puggles, 'K' and Gigi. 'K' is smart, active, hyper, and always on the go. She is a great hunter and is always able to catch her prey. Gigi, on the otherhand, is a fat, overweight seal who doesn't know the difference between a gourmet steak and poop. She is lazy and will eat anything that she can fit in her mouth. She's still pretty cute though and I love her.</p>
